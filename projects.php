        This was my first jQuery project. I chose to build this with jQuery because I wanted to learn more about
        animations. Althought there are tons of carousels out there, I really wanted to build my own.

      <h3>Crazy Ball</h3>

    </a>
      <p>
        This was my first Javascript project that was built without any outside help. The backbone of this project
        is the Math().random function, which was used to determine the next location of the ball.
