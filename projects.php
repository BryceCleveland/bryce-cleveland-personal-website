        This was my first Javascript project that was built without any outside help. The backbone of this project
        is the Math().random function, which was used to determine the next location of the ball.

        The goal of this project was to learn of the manipluate objects on the DOM with keyboard inputs. 
        I also learned how to detect for object collisions and how to build very simple AI.
        This was built using vanilla Javascript

          This is my first website. I built this back in 2014 to learn more about SEO and creating content.
          The site and all the content was built by me using Wordpress.
