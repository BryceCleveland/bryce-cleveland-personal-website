            <p>Hi there, my name is Bryce Cleveland. I'm a very laid back car-guy who loves to learn new skills everyday. Most of my life I have been in the automotive field. But, I recently found my love for web development. I recently enrolled at a local "coding bootcamp" and continue to play with code everyday. </p>

            <h3><a href="#">Projects</a></h3>
              <p>Here you can find some of my recent projects. My projects range from Bootstrap and Materialize themes, to Javascript applications. My favorite things to develop are themes, but Javascript applications are always fun and interesting.</p>
