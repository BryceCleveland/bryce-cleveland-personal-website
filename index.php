            Hello there, my name is Bryce! I'm a junior web developer who loves to learn new skills everyday. 
            I recently found my love for web development and enrolled at a local coding bootcamp.
            I continue to play with code everyday and develop small projects for fun. </p>

              <p>
              Here you can find some of my recent projects. 
              All of my projects are built in vanilla Javascript to decrease complexity. 
              I built this project website using bootstrap with some of my own styles on top.
