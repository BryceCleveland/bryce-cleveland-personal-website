      <p>Hello there, my name is Bryce. I like to write about cars and build websites. I created my first
      website in 2014 after I learned about Wordpress. The site was built with the intentions of learning about content
      curation and SEO. Fast forward a few years and my site is now getting
      a couple thousand hits daily! All this happened because I wanted to learn how to do it for fun.</p>

      <p>Eventually I realized that a career in web development would suit me very well. Not only is it incredibly fun
      and interesting to me, it also has a better future than my previous career path. Be sure to check out my personal
      blog if you really want to get to know me, and also check out my projects on GitHub!</p>
