      <h1>Getting to know me...</h1>
      <p>Hi there, my name is Bryce Cleveland. I'm a very laid back car-guy who loves to learn new skills everyday. Most of my life I have been in the automotive field. Everything from fixing cars, to flipping cars, to writing about cars. The automotive field is so full of different things you can do. But, I came to the conclusion that I don't want to pursue that field professionally. That's what lead me to pursuing a career in the web development field.</p>

      <p><i>Interesting fact:</i> I have owned a total of 18 vehicles. Most of them I owned from the age of 17 to 20. From 20 to 22 I owned 2 vehicles</p>
